# Simple Blockchain Development Project
This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain, designed to help understand the core principles of blockchain technology, such as blocks, hashing, Proof of Work (PoW), and mining.

📋 Features
1. Block Structure
Each block contains:
Index: Position in the chain.
Timestamp: Time of creation.
Data: Transaction or custom information.
Previous Hash: Reference to the preceding block’s hash.
Hash: Unique identifier for the block.
Nonce: Number used in Proof of Work.

2. Genesis Block
Creates the first block in the blockchain to initialize the chain.

3. Proof of Work (PoW)
Implements a computational challenge to secure the blockchain.
Ensures only valid blocks can be added by solving a hash-based puzzle.

4. Mining Blocks
Uses the Proof of Work mechanism to add new blocks securely.

5. Blockchain Validation
Verifies the integrity of the blockchain by checking:
Hash consistency.
Linkage between blocks.

⚙️ How It Works
Blocks
Each block contains data and references the hash of the previous block.

Proof of Work
A mining process where the hash of the block must meet a specific difficulty level (e.g., start with 0000).

Validation
The chain is validated by ensuring that:

Each block’s hash matches its content.
The previous hash matches the preceding block’s hash.

🚀 Getting Started
Set Up Environment
Install a Java development environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Compile and Run
Execute the program to create your blockchain.

Experiment
Try adding and mining new blocks to observe how the blockchain works.

🔧 Example Usage


// Create the genesis block
Block genesisBlock = createGenesisBlock();
addBlock(genesisBlock);

// Mine and add a new block
Block newBlock = new Block(1, "Transaction Data: Alice pays Bob 10 BTC", genesisBlock.hash);
newBlock.mineBlock(4); // Difficulty level: 4
addBlock(newBlock);

// Check blockchain validity
System.out.println("Is blockchain valid? " + isChainValid());

📊 Output Example

Genesis Block created with hash: 0000abcd1234...
Mining block 1...
Block mined! Hash: 0000efgh5678...
Is blockchain valid? true

🛠️ Customization

Feel free to:

Modify block data to include additional fields.
Experiment with different difficulty levels for mining.
Implement additional features like transactions, wallets, or a consensus algorithm.
