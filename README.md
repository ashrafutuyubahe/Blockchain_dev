Simple Blockchain Development Project
This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain, designed to help understand the core principles of blockchain technology, such as blocks, hashing, Proof of Work (PoW), and mining.

üìã Features

Block Structure Each block contains: Index: Position in the chain. Timestamp: Time of creation. Data: Transaction or custom information. Previous Hash: Reference to the preceding block‚Äôs hash. Hash: Unique identifier for the block. Nonce: Number used in Proof of Work.

Genesis Block Creates the first block in the blockchain to initialize the chain.

Proof of Work (PoW) Implements a computational challenge to secure the blockchain. Ensures only valid blocks can be added by solving a hash-based puzzle.

Mining Blocks Uses the Proof of Work mechanism to add new blocks securely.

Blockchain Validation Verifies the integrity of the blockchain by checking: Hash consistency. Linkage between blocks.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Blocks Each block contains data and references the hash of the previous block.

Proof of Work A mining process where the hash of the block must meet a specific difficulty level (e.g., start with 0000).

Validation The chain is validated by ensuring that:

Each block‚Äôs hash matches its content. The previous hash matches the preceding block‚Äôs hash.
